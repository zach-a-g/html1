        <p>This exercise is about making lists</p>
        <p>Here is what I like about lists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
            <li>Thats about it</li>
            <li>I'm gonna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you make a list do it in this order:
            <ol>
                <li>Decide if it is an ordered list or not</li>
                <li>If it is not an ordered list, us the ul tag, otherwise us the ol tag</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside of each other</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
                <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
